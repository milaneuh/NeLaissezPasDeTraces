# Leave No Trace Awareness App

This project is my initiative to educate and raise awareness about the **"Leave No Trace"** principles, promoting environmental responsibility and encouraging sustainable outdoor practices. The application includes a **10-question quiz** designed to teach young audiences about these principles in an engaging and interactive way. I've also added a **presentation mode** for educators, allowing them to display each question, see the chosen answer, and move to the next question without point tracking, making it ideal for classroom or group settings.

## Features

- **Quiz Mode:** A simple, intuitive quiz interface with 10 questions aimed at promoting environmental awareness.
- **Presentation Mode:** An educator-friendly mode where each question can be displayed, answered, and advanced without point tracking, ideal for classroom discussions.

## Technologies I Used

This project is built using a modern stack to enhance interactivity and efficiency:

- **Spring Boot:** Backend framework for creating a RESTful API and handling business logic.
- **HTMX:** Enables seamless asynchronous interactions without requiring a full page reload, enhancing user experience.
- **Java Template Engine (JTE):** Server-side template engine used to render dynamic HTML pages based on the data provided by the backend.
- **AlpineJS:** Lightweight JavaScript framework to manage front-end interactions and state.

## Goals

My primary goal is to inspire more conscious and respectful interactions with nature, making outdoor activities safer and more sustainable for everyone. By learning about "Leave No Trace" principles, I hope users will understand the importance of minimizing human impact on the environment and preserving natural spaces.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have **Java 21+** installed.
3. Run the Spring Boot application.
