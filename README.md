#Leave no trace
"Leave No Trace" Awareness App

This project is dedicated to educating and raising awareness about the "Leave No Trace" principles, promoting environmental responsibility and encouraging sustainable outdoor practices. The application includes a 10-question quiz designed for young audiences to learn about these principles in an engaging and interactive way. It also features a presentation mode, allowing educators to display questions and see answers without scoring, making it ideal for classroom use.

Our goal is to inspire more conscious and respectful interactions with nature, making outdoor activities safer and more sustainable for everyone.
